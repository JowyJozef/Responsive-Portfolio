          <p>For as long as I can remember, I've always been a creator. I've always been someone who
            loves to tinker, modify, create and build things. 
            I've always had this desire to keep learning
            no matter how difficult the topic may be.</p>
            <p>I love the thrill of building things with technology. I've always had a thing for computers 
            and how they work. I love to make music, develop web pages and also see how other web pages work. 
            I hope to one day dig in to machine learning, artificial inteligence and build things from scratch.
            </p>
          <p>I believe it is in me to create, to develop, to problem solve and to understand how things work.
            And I love doing all of those things with technology.</p>
